Over the last couple years, my hunger for learning computer science has grown.
And I'd like to document that journey, dedicating this entire blog.  Because for
the next 3 years, I'll be pursuing my master's in computer science, starting in
January 2019, when I (hopefully) enroll for my first course at University of
Georgia Tech, all while working full time as a software engineer at Amazon (Web
Services).
